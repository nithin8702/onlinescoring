OnlineScoring Quick Readme

 INSTALLATION
==============

1. Import db/onlinescoring.sql (the database schema) into your mysql database:

	mysql -u user -p -h host dbname < db/onlinescoring.sql

2. Copy src/config.ini.sample to src/config.ini.php .
3. Edit the newly created config.ini.php and specify your own values.
4. Make sure your web server is running PHP 5.3 with MySQLi, pecl_http, APC and XSLT extensions.

5. a) Make an alias in your webserver config for src/. For example, for Apache 2.x, one would add this to httpd.conf:
	-----------------------------------------------
	<Directory /path/to/onlinescoring/src>
		Options FollowSymLinks
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

	Alias /onlinescoring /path/to/onlinescoring/src
	-----------------------------------------------

	-OR-
	
   b) Copy the contents of the src/ folder into your web directory on a LAMP server.
      Future updates will have to be copied manually into your web directory too.

6. Create a cron job that runs <web_root>/utils/checkdiff.php every hour or so.

NOTE:

Right now, you can only login with your @gmail.com, @neuroinfo.org account or another domain hosted on Google Apps.
We don't just give out @neuroinfo.org accounts so if your domain is not hosted with Google you should probably use your @gmail.com account.
Note: We do not store your password. We even don't like the fact that it goes through our application, but if you really want to ensure your password isn't stored 
anywhere in this app, take a look at ajax/login.php and then NRG/Login/Google/ClientLogin.php. They're just passing the password to each other, and then to Google using an https connection. 

By default, @neuroinfo.org is appended to your username on the login screen (if the e-mail does not contain an @ sign). For your convenience, make sure to edit the DEFAULT_DOMAIN variable in src/js/login.js.

This is a temporary hack. In the future, we'll add LDAP and NIS support.
