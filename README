OnlineScoring Quick Readme

==============
 INSTALLATION
==============

1. Import db/onlinescoring.sql (the database schema) into your mysql database:

	mysql -u user -p -h host dbname < db/onlinescoring.sql

2. Copy src/config.ini.sample to src/config.ini.php .
3. Edit the newly created config.ini.php and specify your own values.
   -IMPORTANT- Make sure to uncomment the 'setupkey' line and specify your own temporary secret key.
               Remove the setupkey line after you're done setting up OnlineScoring.
4. Make sure your web server is running PHP 5.3 with MySQLi, pecl_http, APC and XSLT extensions.

5. a) Add an alias in your webserver config for src/. For example, for Apache 2.x, one would add this to httpd.conf:
	-----------------------------------------------
	<Directory /path/to/onlinescoring/src>
		Options FollowSymLinks
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

	Alias /onlinescoring /path/to/onlinescoring/src
	-----------------------------------------------

	-OR-
	
   b) Copy the contents of the src/ folder into your web directory on a LAMP server.
      Future updates will have to be copied manually into your web directory too.

6. Log in as user 'SYSTEM' and the setupkey (from config.ini.php) as the password.
7. Go directly to the Users page (do not pass Go, do not collect $200) and add a new entry for yourself (see the NOTE below).
   There is no password. You should make sure your account is enabled (it should have a green circle next to the username). If it's not enabled,
   then, by all means, select your new account and goto Account->Enable. Obviously, you would want to set yourself as part of
   the Administrators group.
   

8. Create a cron job that runs <web_root>/utils/checkdiff.php every hour or so.

 NOTE
======

At this point in time, you can only login with your @gmail.com, @neuroinfo.org account or another domain hosted on Google Apps.
We don't just give out @neuroinfo.org accounts so, if your domain is not hosted with Google, you should probably use your @gmail.com account.

FYI: We do not keep, peek at, nor steal your password. We don't even like the fact that it goes through our application, but we must log you in somehow, so, at least wemake sure we're not storing it anywhere. Thus, even if your web server is compromised, your account password is still safe and sound.

By default, when you log in, @neuroinfo.org is appended to your username (if the e-mail does not contain an @ sign). For your convenience, make sure to edit the DEFAULT_DOMAIN variable in src/js/login.js.

This is all temporary. In the future, we'll add LDAP and NIS support.
